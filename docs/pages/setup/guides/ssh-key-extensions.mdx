## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version) Open Source or Enterprise.

## Step 1. Configure key extensions to be included in key generation.

Create or update a role to include the `cert_extensions` option.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  options:
     cert_extensions:
       - type: ssh
         mode: extension
         name: login@github.com
         value: "{{ internal.logins }}"
```

## Step 2. Generate the users certificate.

The users certificate may be generated with the following command 

```code
tctl auth sign --out out.cer --user=$USERNAME
```

This would be equivalent to running with manual ssh commands.

```code
$ ssh-keygen -s ./ca-key \
	         -V '+1d' -I KEY-IDENTITY \
			 -O extension:login@github.com=USERNAME \
			 ./user-key.pub
```
